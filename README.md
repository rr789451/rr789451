# 👋 Hi, I'm Rohit

**Architect of Seamless UX** | Full-Stack Developer | Product-First Thinker

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a functionality-driven developer who designs with flow in mind. Whether it's crafting responsive carousels, engineering toggle-based UI components, or optimizing API workflows, I always aim for **clarity without compromise**. Think of me as the bridge between robust logic and refined user experiences.

🔧 I build systems that work — and feel right.

I obsess over:
- Intuitive **user onboarding flows**
- UI/UX microinteractions that **just work**
- Frontend-first development with a **seamless backend handoff**
- Architecting **Netflix-level product experiences** in lean codebases

### 🔍 Fun Facts
- I *love* procedural TV dramas (The Mentalist, White Collar, Lie to Me).
- I have strong opinions about toggle switches vs. buttons. (Spoiler: I pick toggles.)
- I make **accessibility-first** AI tools. Seamless UX isn’t a bonus — it’s a requirement.
